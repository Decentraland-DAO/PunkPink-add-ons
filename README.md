# PunkPink add-ons for Decentraland wearables

## Abstact ##
This is a repository that contains more than 800 add-ons, which are pieces that you can assemble to create complete and original wearables in Decentraland without having knowledge of 3D modeling. Below are some steps to create a wearable using add-ons.

## Creating wearables with add-ons ##
### Step 1: Get Blender ###
Blender is a 3D modeling editor, download and install it: [https://www.blender.org/download/](https://www.blender.org/download/)

### Step 2: Select the add-ons ###
Explore the folders in this repository to find the add-ons that best fit the wearable you want to build.

* To understand how the add-ons are organized in this repository you can check the “Repo structure” section.

* To know how many add-ons you should download according to the category, check the “Parts of a wearable according to category” section.

### Step 3: Import ###
Open Blender and go to File > Import > glTF 2.0 (.glb/.gltf).

### Step 4: Export ###
Select an Add-on and then press the “A” key (this will select all add-ons or meshes).

Press Ctrl+J (this will join all the add-ons into one).

* Tip: If you click the "Viewport Shading" button you will be able to see how your wearable looks.

Go to the “Shading” tab.

In the right column there is a ball icon called “Material Properties”, enter there.

A list of materials will appear, with the “-” button located to the right of the list, eliminate materials until only one remains (it doesn't matter which ones you eliminate, only leave one).

### Step 5: Publish ###
Go to the Decentraland builder and upload the .GLB file to publish.

## Repo structure ##
Each of the folders contains files with a GLB extension, these are the add-ons that you must download, on the other hand each of the GLB has a PNG image with the same name so that you can see what the add-on is like before downloading it.
All add-ons are organized in the following folders:

**Feet folder:** Contains all the add-ons of the Feet category: Left base, Right base, Left shoelaces, Right shoelaces, Left sole, Right sole, Left toecap, Right toecap, Left toecap sole and Right toecap sole.

**Female Lower body folder:** Contains all the add-ons of the female Lower body category: Waist, Left thigh, Right thigh, Left knee, Right knee, Left leg and Right leg.

**Male Lower body folder:** Contains all the add-ons of the male Lower body category: Waist, Left thigh, Right thigh, Left knee, Right knee, Left leg and Right leg.

**Female Upper body folder:** Contains all the add-ons of the female Upper body category: Torso, Neck, Left arm, Right arm, Left elbow, Right elbow, Left forearm and Right forearm.

**Male Upper body folder:** Contains all the add-ons of the male Upper body category: Torso, Neck, Left arm, Right arm, Left elbow, Right elbow, Left forearm and Right forearm.

**Skin Folder:** Contains the original body parts with the skin texture of all the previous categories, this is useful if you want to build a wearable with short sleeves or with certain parts exposed such as a thigh, knee, etc.
