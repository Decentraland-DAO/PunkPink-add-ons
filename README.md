# PunkPink add-ons for Decentraland wearables

<h2>Abstact</h2>
This is a repository that contains more than 800 add-ons, which are pieces that you can assemble to create complete and original wearables in Decentraland without having knowledge of 3D modeling. Below are some steps to create a wearable using add-ons.

<h2>Creating wearables with add-ons</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Get Blender</h3>
Blender is a 3D modeling editor, download and install it: <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/" target="_blank">https://www.blender.org/download/</a>

<h3>Step 2: Select the add-ons</h3>
Explore the folders in this repository to find the add-ons that best fit the wearable you want to build.
* To understand how the add-ons are organized in this repository you can check the “Repo structure” section.
* To know how many add-ons you should download according to the category, check the “Parts of a wearable according to category” section.

<h3>Step 3: Import</h3>
1 - Open Blender and go to File > Import > glTF 2.0 (.glb/.gltf)

2 – Go to the folder where you downloaded the add-ons you chose, select them and click on “Import”



<h3>Step 4: Export</h3>
1 – Select an Add-on and then press the “A” key (this will select all add-ons or meshes)

2 – Press Ctrl+J (this will join all the add-ons into one)

* Tip: If you click the "Viewport Shading" button you will be able to see how your wearable looks.

3 – Go to the “Shading” tab

4 – In the right column there is a ball icon called “Material Properties”, enter there.

5 – A list of materials will appear, with the “-” button located to the right of the list, eliminate materials until only one remains (it doesn't matter which ones you eliminate, only leave one).

6 – Go to File > Export > glTF 2.0 (.glb/.gltf), save the final file wherever you want.

<h3>Step 5: Publish</h3>
Go to the Decentraland builder and upload the .GLB file to publish.

<h2>Repo structure</h2>
Each of the folders contains files with a GLB extension, these are the add-ons that you must download, on the other hand each of the GLB has a PNG image with the same name so that you can see what the add-on is like before downloading it .
All add-ons are organized in the following folders:

Feet Folder: Contains all the add-ons of the Feet category: Left base, Right base, Left shoelaces, Right shoelaces, Left sole, Right sole, Left toecap, Right toecap, Left toecap sole and Right toecap sole.

Lower body folder: Contains all the add-ons of the Lower body category: Waist, Left thigh, Right thigh, Left knee, Right knee, Left leg and Right leg.

Upper body folder: Contains all the add-ons of the Upper body category: Torso, Neck, Left arm, Right arm, Left elbow, Right elbow, Left forearm and Right forearm.

Skin Folder: Contains the original body parts with the skin texture of all the previous categories, this is useful if you want to build a wearable with short sleeves or with certain parts exposed such as a thigh, knee, etc.
